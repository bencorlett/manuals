###Installation

----------

Once downloaded, you will need to install and enable the extension in your Extensions Manager (within the admin of your Platform installation).

The Extensions Manager is located at `http://your-platform-install/admin/extensions`. Alternatively, you can visit `System -> Extensions` in your administration area of Platform (on a default installation of Platform).
