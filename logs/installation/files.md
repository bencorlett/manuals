### Files

----------

Installing Logs files is pretty straight forward.  We set up the directory to allow you to just drag and drop the root folder into your platform install and not worry about anything besides changing your theme name for the views if you so desire. If you modified your platform installation at all, you will simply just need to modify your file structure or copy in each `logs` folder appropriately.  No file editing needs to be done.
