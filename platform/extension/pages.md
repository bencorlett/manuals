###Pages

----------

Pages is where you can make pages for the frontend of your site.  Currently this is our temporary solution for a CMS.  To make additional pages, you just need to go into the pages controller and add new methods for each page.  Just make sure that a page does not have the same name as another extension or bundle as that extension or bundles uri takes priority over a page.
