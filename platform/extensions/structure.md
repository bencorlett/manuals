###Structure

----------

Here is an example folder structure for an Extension. We'll use Users for our example. Note that most of the structure is optional depending on what you want to do with your extension.  The only non-optional item is the new extension.php file.

----------

* extension_name
	* controllers
		* admin *( new )*
			* admin controllers
		* api *( new )*
			* api controllers
	* language
	* migrations
	* models
	* plugins *( new )*
	* widgets *( new )*
	* extension.php *( new | required )*
	* routes.php
	* start.php
