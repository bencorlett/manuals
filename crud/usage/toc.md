The best way to use Crud is to make a new Model and extend Crud. For the examples in this chapter, we'll have a `User` model that extends crud.

* [Setup](#setup "/manuals/crud/usage/setup")
* [Create](#create "/manuals/crud/usage/create")
* [Read](#create "/manuals/crud/usage/read")
* [Update](#update "/manuals/crud/usage/update")
* [Delete](#delete "/manuals/crud/usage/delete")
